🌦️ AI-Powered Forecast & Crypto Insight Platform

A backend-focused, API-driven platform that combines real-time weather forecasting, crypto market data aggregation, note-taking, and LLM-powered interaction. Built with a modular architecture for scalability, experimentation, and future ML integration.

🔑 Key Features
	•	🔐 API Key-Based Authorization
Secure authentication via custom API key generation and validation.
	•	🌍 Location-Based Weather Forecasts with LLM Summaries
Weather data is enriched with natural language summaries generated by a large language model (LLM), based on the user’s geolocation.
	•	📝 Note-Taking System
Users can create and store personal notes through authenticated API endpoints.
	•	📊 Crypto Market Data Collection
Periodically fetches technical indicators (RSI, EMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic RSI) from Binance and stores them in a local MS SQL Server database for future ML training and trend analysis.
	•	🧠 LLM-Powered Conversation API
A natural language endpoint for querying weather, crypto insights, or general AI chat—enhanced by real-time data when relevant.

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	.NET 8 – RESTful API Services
	•	MS SQL Server – Data Storage
	•	Binance API & OpenWeather API – Data Sources
	•	Ollama / Local LLM – AI Layer (for chat and summarization)

🎯 Project Goals
	•	Demonstrate clean API design and secure authentication
	•	Merge real-time data processing with AI reasoning
	•	Serve as a foundation for time-series ML experimentation
	•	Enable user-centric workflows (notes, queries) through simple endpoints
