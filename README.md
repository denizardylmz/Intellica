## 🔑 Key Features

- **🔐 API Key-Based Authorization**  
  Secure authentication via custom API key generation and validation.

- **🌍 Location-Based Weather Forecasts with LLM Summaries**  
  Weather data is enriched with natural language summaries generated by a large language model (LLM), based on the user's geolocation.

- **📝 Note-Taking System**  
  Users can create and store personal notes through authenticated API endpoints.

- **📊 Crypto Market Data Collection**  
  Periodically fetches technical indicators (RSI, EMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic RSI) from Binance and stores them in a local MS SQL Server database for ML training and trend analysis.

- **🧠 LLM-Powered Conversation API**  
  A natural language endpoint for querying weather, crypto insights, or general AI chat—enhanced by real-time data when relevant.
